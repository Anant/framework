# Assessment for Apprentices

This is an assessment we use to see what your level of aptitude is with industry tools that are freely available on the internet. 
We send this assessment to candidates we feel are good at the basic knowledge and are able to communicate. The goal is to see how you can use existing
documentation to achieve this or to figure something out. A big part of our company's work is to learn new tools, teach it internally, and communicate it to clients.
